# Data structures and algorithsm

This repository contains data structures and algorithms coding problems organized by type of problem solving techniques sometimes and sometimes by the type of data structure used.

Overall the aim of this repository is to have atleast as close to 600 problems to be solved in data structures and algorithms to improve my coding skills as well as serve as a place to quickly prepare for other folks on the internet.
